# Project Codex Clone (Fitch Edition)

## Vision
A high-performance "Agent Command Center" that mirrors the features of OpenAI's Codex app. 
Focus: Moving from "one-on-one coding" to "team supervision."

## Key Features
1. **Agent Swarm Orchestration:** A lead agent (Fitch) manages domain-specific workers (Frontend, Backend, QA, DevOps).
2. **Visual Feedback Loop:** Integrated screenshot capture and analysis using Kimi K2.5 to verify UI/UX development.
3. **Design-to-Code Pipeline:** Ability to ingest UI screenshots (or Figma-like contexts) and generate production-ready code.
4. **Unified Control Interface:** Integrated into the 'Jarvis Dashboard' or a dedicated terminal view.

## Staff Allocation
- **Lead Architect:** Fitch (Gemini Flash)
- **Mathematical/Vision Worker:** Kimi K2.5 (NVIDIA NIM)
- **Speed/Boilerplate Workers:** Gemini 3 Flash / 2.5 Flash
- **Coding Specialist:** Claude 4.5 Opus (Fallback)

## Immediate Roadmap
- [ ] Define the 'Worker Protocol' (how agents talk to each other).
- [ ] Implement 'Visual Verification' skill (screenshot + AI audit).
- [ ] Integrate with existing 'Spatial-Observer' for visionOS specific coding.

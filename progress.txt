# Queen Bee - Progress Log

## Status: 2026-02-09
**Current Focus:** Phase 7 - VoxYZ Gap Implementation (Agent Coordination & Architecture)

### 1. Audit & Foundation
- [x] Audited current codebase state.
- [x] Fixed `SessionManager.ts`: Added missing methods for thread lifecycle.
- [x] Created Foundation: `PolicyStore.ts`, `EventLog.ts`, `MemoryStore.ts`.
- [x] Created API endpoints for policies and events.
- [x] Wired Foundation into `ToolExecutor.ts` and `AgentSession.ts`.

### 2. Heartbeat & Recovery
- [x] Implemented `HeartbeatService.ts` with periodic tick.
- [x] Added timestamping to `claimTask` in `ProjectTaskManager.ts` and `TaskManager.ts`.
- [x] Implemented Stale Task Recovery logic in `HeartbeatService`.
- [x] Verified `HeartbeatService` is started in `server.ts`.

### 3. Coordination & Social
- [x] Implemented `ProposalService.ts` for gating risky actions.
- [x] Implemented `TriggerEngine.ts` and `ReactionMatrix.ts` for reactive behaviors.
- [x] Implemented `Roundtable.ts` shared team channel.
- [x] Added `chat_with_team` tool to `ToolExecutor.ts`.
- [x] Injected Roundtable context into `AutonomousRunner.ts` system prompts.

### 4. Advanced Memory (Current)
- [x] Implemented `MemoryDistillation.ts`.
- [x] Wired `MemoryDistillation` into `AgentSession.ts` for automated session processing.
- [x] Implemented memory-influenced system prompt in `AutonomousRunner.ts`.

## Next Actions
1. Verify the end-to-end flow of a multi-agent swarm.
2. Address any remaining Phase 6 or BP tasks.
3. Clean up and finalize the VoxYZ architecture.
